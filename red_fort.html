    <h2>Red Fort</h2>
    <p>The Delhi Fort, also known as Lal Qil'ah, or Lal Qila, meaning the Red Fort, located in Delhi, India, has been awarded the UNESCO World Heritage Site designation in 2007.[1] The Red Fort served as the palace for Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan's new capital, Shahjahanabad, the seventh Muslim city in the Delhi site.The Red Fort served as the main residence for the Mughal emperors for around 200 years. It is a symbol of India's struggle for independence and was the place where the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, raised the Indian national flag on August 15, 1947, marking India's independence from British colonial rule.he Red Fort has become a symbol for Indian independence from British rule, with the Prime Minister addressing the nation from the Red Fort every Independence Day, August 15th. That is remarkable when considering that India, predominately Hindu, has chosen as a symbol for national unity a Fort of Islamic architecture. That is fitting with India's commitment throughout the post-independence period of bringing Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Buddhist, Christian, and Muslim together in the creation of the Republic of India.</p>
    
    <h3>Historical Significance</h3>
    <p>Shan Jahan moved his capital from Agra in an attempt to bring prestige to his reign, and to provide ample opportunity to fulfill his ambitious building schemes and interests. The Red Fort stands at the eastern edge of Shahjahanabad, receiving its name from the massive wall of red sandstone that defines its four sides. The wall stands 1.5 miles (2.5 km) long, and varies in height from 60 ft (16m) on the river side to 110 ft (33 m) towards the city. Measurements have shown that a square grid of 82 m had been used to generate the plan.
<p>The architect of the Lotus Temple was an Iranian, Fariborz Sahba who now lives in La Jolla, California,[7] after spending some years in Canada.[8] He was approached in 1976 to design the Lotus Temple and later oversaw its construction. The structural design was undertaken by the UK firm Flint and Neill over the course of 18 months,[9] and the construction was done by ECC Construction Group of Larsen & Toubro Limited[10][dead link] at a cost of $10.56 million.[11][12] The major part of the funds needed to buy this land was donated by Ardishír Rustampúr of Hyderabad, Sindh (Pakistan), whose will dictated that his entire life savings would go toward the building of the temple.[13][page needed] A portion of the construction budget was saved and used to build a greenhouse to study indigenous plants and flowers that would be appropriate for use on the site.[14]

  Rúhíyyih Khánum laid the foundation stone for the Lotus Temple on 19 October 1977 and dedicated the temple on 24 December 1986.[15] For the dedication, there was a gathering of 8,000 Baháʼís from 107 countries, including some 4,000 Baháʼís from 22 provinces in India. The temple was opened to the public on 1 January 1987 and more than 10,000 people visited that day.[16]</p>

        General view of the complex
        The fort lies along the Yamuna River, which feeds the moats that surround most of the wall. The wall at its north-eastern corner sits adjacent to an older fort, the Salimgarh Fort, a defense built by Islam Shah Suri in 1546. Construction on the Red Fort began in 1638, finishing in 1648. Incidentally, the Ancient City of Lal Kot, captured by Shah Jahan, literally means Red (Lal) Fort (Kot). Lal Kot served the capital city of Prithviraj Chauhan in the late twelfth century.
        
        On March 11, 1783, Sikhs entered Red Fort in Delhi and occupied the Diwan-i-Am. The Mughal wazir, unified with his Sikh Allies, essentially surrendered the city, carried out by the command of the Sardar Baghel Singh Dhaliwal of the Karor Singhia misl, on the third of his three campaigns to conquer Delhi.
        
        The Red Fort had been built according to a comprehensive blueprint, and subsequent modifications had preserved the overall unity of the scheme. In the eighteenth century, occupiers and looters damaged some sections of the palace. After the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, when the Fort served as a headquarters, the British army occupied and destroyed about four-fifths of its pavilions and gardens.[2] A program for restoring the surviving parts of the fort began in 1903..</p>
  <p>The Lotus Temple is situated near Okhla NSIC and Kalkaji Mandir metro station is just 500 meters away.[citation needed] It is in the village of Bahapur in New Delhi, National Capital Territory of Delhi, near Nehru Place.[23]

    Of the temple's total electricity use of 500 kilowatts (kW), 120 kW is provided by solar power generated by solar panels on the building.[24] This saves the temple ₹120,000 per month.[24] It is the first temple in Delhi to use solar power.[25]
    
    As is the case with other stone monuments such as the Taj Mahal, the Lotus Temple is becoming discoloured due to air pollution in India. Specifically, the white marble is turning grey and yellow due to pollution from vehicles and manufacturing in the city, among other sources.[26]</p>
