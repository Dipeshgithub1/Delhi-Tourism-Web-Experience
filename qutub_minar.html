    <h2>Qutub Minar</h2>
    <p>Qutub Minar, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is a historic monument located in City Name. It is known for its magnificent architecture and historical significance.</p>
    
    <h3>Historical Significance</h3>
    <p>Qutub Minar was built in the 12th century by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, the founder of the Delhi Sultanate. It stands as a remarkable example of Indo-Islamic architecture. The minaret reaches a height of 73 meters and is constructed from red sandstone and marble. It is adorned with intricate carvings and verses from the Quran.The Qutb Minar was built over the ruins of the Lal Kot, the citadel of Dhillika.[7] Qutub Minar was begun after the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque. Drawing references from their Ghurid homeland, Qutub-ud-Din Aibak and Shamsu’d-Din Iltutmish constructed a minar (minaret) at the south-eastern corner of the Quwwatu’l-Islam between 1199 and 1503</p>
    
    <p>The site also includes several other historical structures, including the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, Alai Darwaza, and the Iron Pillar, which is famous for its rust resistance and inscription.It is usually thought that the tower is named for Qutb-ud-din Aibak, who began it. It is also possible that it is named after Khwaja Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki a 13th-century sufi saint, because Shamsuddin Iltutmish was a devotee of his.[15]

      The Minar is surrounded by several historically significant monuments of the Qutb complex. Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, to the north-east of the Minar was built by Qutub-ud-Din Aibak in A.D. 1199. It is the earliest extant - mosque built by the Delhi Sultans. It consists of a rectangular courtyard enclosed by cloisters, erected with the carved columns and architectural members of 27 Jain and Hindu temples, which were demolished by Qutub-ud-Din Aibak as recorded in his inscription on the main eastern entrance.[16] Later, a lofty arched screen was erected, and the mosque was enlarged, by Shams-ud- Din Itutmish (A.D. 1210-35) and Ala-ud-Din Khalji. The Iron Pillar in the courtyard bears an inscription in Sanskrit in Brahmi script of fourth century A.D., according to which the pillar was set up as a Vishnudhvaja (standard of god Vishnu) on the hill known as Vishnupada in memory of a mighty king named Chandra.[16]
      
      The mosque complex is one of the earliest that survives in the Indian subcontinent.[6][7]
      
      The nearby pillared cupola known as "Smith's Folly" is a remnant of the tower's 19th century restoration, which included an ill-advised attempt to add some more stories.[17][18]
      
      In 1505, an earthquake damaged Qutub Minar; it was repaired by Sikander Lodi. On 1 September 1803, a major earthquake caused serious damage. Major Robert Smith of the British Indian Army renovated the tower in 1828 and installed a pillared cupola over the fifth story, creating a sixth. The cupola was taken down in 1848, under instructions from The Viscount Hardinge, who was the Governor General of India. at the time. It was reinstalled at ground level to the east of Qutb Minar, where it remains. This is known as "Smith's Folly".[19]
      
      It was added to the list of World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1993.</p>
