    <h2>Lotus Temple</h2>
    <p>Lotus Temple, also known as the Bahá'í House of Worship, is a unique and contemporary religious structure in City Name. It is renowned for its distinctive lotus-like architecture and serves as a place for meditation and prayer.</p>
    
    <h3>Architectural Significance</h3>
    <p>Designed by Iranian-Canadian architect Fariborz Sahba, the Lotus Temple is characterized by its lotus flower-inspired design, which symbolizes purity, peace, and unity. The temple is built using white marble and consists of 27 free-standing marble-clad "petals" arranged in clusters.</p>
    <p>All Baháʼí Houses of Worship, including the Lotus Temple, share certain architectural elements, some of which are specified by Baháʼí scripture. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion, wrote that Baháʼí Houses of Worship must be nine-sided and circular.[17] While all current Baháʼí Houses of Worship have a dome, this is not regarded as an essential part of their architecture.[15] Baháʼí scripture also states that no pictures, statues or images be displayed within the House of Worship, and no pulpits or altars be incorporated as an architectural feature (readers may stand behind simple portable lecture stands).[17]

      Inspired by the lotus flower, the design for the House of Worship in New Delhi is composed of 27 free-standing marble-clad "petals" arranged in clusters of three to form nine sides.[18] The temple's shape has symbolic and inter-religious significance because the lotus is often associated with purity, sacredness, spirituality, and knowledge. It has a spiritual significance in India.[4] The nine doors of the Lotus Temple open onto a central hall 34.3 meters tall[1] that can seat 1,300 people[19] and hold up to 2,500 in all.[2] The temple has a diameter of 70 m.[20] The surface of the House of Worship is made of white marble from Penteli mountain in Greece, the same marble used in the construction of many ancient monuments (including the Parthenon[19]) and other Baháʼí buildings.[21] Along with its nine surrounding ponds and gardens, the Lotus Temple property comprises 26 acres (105,000 m2; 10.5 ha).[5] An educational centre beside the temple was established in 2017.</p>
    <h3>Historical Significance</h3>
    <p>The architect of the Lotus Temple was an Iranian, Fariborz Sahba who now lives in La Jolla, California,[7] after spending some years in Canada.[8] He was approached in 1976 to design the Lotus Temple and later oversaw its construction. The structural design was undertaken by the UK firm Flint and Neill over the course of 18 months,[9] and the construction was done by ECC Construction Group of Larsen & Toubro Limited[10][dead link] at a cost of $10.56 million.[11][12] The major part of the funds needed to buy this land was donated by Ardishír Rustampúr of Hyderabad, Sindh (Pakistan), whose will dictated that his entire life savings would go toward the building of the temple.[13][page needed] A portion of the construction budget was saved and used to build a greenhouse to study indigenous plants and flowers that would be appropriate for use on the site.[14]

      Rúhíyyih Khánum laid the foundation stone for the Lotus Temple on 19 October 1977 and dedicated the temple on 24 December 1986.[15] For the dedication, there was a gathering of 8,000 Baháʼís from 107 countries, including some 4,000 Baháʼís from 22 provinces in India. The temple was opened to the public on 1 January 1987 and more than 10,000 people visited that day.[</p>
